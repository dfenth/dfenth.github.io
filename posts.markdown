[Natural adversaries and out-of-distribution detection](../research/ai/adversarial-attacks/out-of-distribution/2021/10/21/natural-adv-ood.html)

A brief look at a more 'natural' approach to adversarial attacks and whether they can be considered to be 'within distribution' of the original model.

[Feature Visualisation Part 1](../research/ai/interpretability/feature-vis/2024/01/03/unreg_feature_extract.html)

Making a start with feature visualisation! This is a really cool method when trying to interpret the information a network is learning.

[Feature Visualisation Part 2](../research/ai/interpretability/feature-vis/2024/01/04/reg-feature-extract.html)

Discusses the more advanced aspects of feature visualisation improving on the previous part!

[Rubbish Images](../research/ai/adversarial-attacks/out-of-distribution/2024/09/28/rubbish-images.html)

Looks at a particular weakness of neural networks when we give them out-of-distribution data to classify.
