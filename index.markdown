Welcome to my web page. I'm Daniel Fentham a PhD student studying in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). My research focuses on security and interpretability of AI models.
        
> Thesis title: **Bayesian Geometric Deep Learning for Cyber Security**. The particulars of my thesis proposal can be found [here](Thesis_Proposal.pdf) (this is a bit old now and we've changed direction a bit since!).
        
My supervisors are [Professor Mark Ryan](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk//~mdr/?_ga=2.32706301.2125069532.1564999758-78132280.1554201023) and [Professor Dave Parker](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david.parker/home.html)!

This website aims to be a collection of things I've learned over the years and need to remember! This includes posts which contribute directly or indirectly to my PhD, along with some other fun things if I find the time. I've been pretty bad at posting in the past since I haven't been comfortable with a piece if I haven't thoroughly checked it through multiple times to ensure everything I'm saying is correct. This adds a lot of mental overhead which means that I just don't post. This year (2024) I've decided to take a different approach where I'll be adding blog posts in any state, with the idea that these will act as living documents which change and evolve as I learn new things, correct mistakes and develop different opinions. So, just like with ChatGPT, I hope that these posts are interesting, but don't blindly believe them without doing some research of your own!
