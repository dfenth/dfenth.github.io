Welcome to my web page. I'm Daniel Fentham a PhD student studying in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). My research focuses on adversarial attacks on Deep Neural Networks, which essentially means I try to make AI systems behave in strange ways for no (obvious) reason to us lowly humans.
        
> Thesis title: **Bayesian Geometric Deep Learning for Cyber Security**. The particulars of my thesis proposal can be found [here](Thesis_Proposal.pdf).
        
My supervisors are [Professor Mark Ryan](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/computer-science/ryan-mark.aspx) and [Professor Dave Parker](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/computer-science/parker-david.aspx)!
        
I also have the help of [Professor Flavio Garcia](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/computer-science/garcia-flavio.aspx) and [Dr Hyung Jin Chang](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/computer-science/chang-jin-hyung.aspx) who have kindly agreed to be a part of my thesis group.
