## Profile ⌘
---
Research Assistant at the University of Birmingham with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence. Over 5 years of hands-on experience developing models that deliver impactful, responsible, and secure solutions at the forefront of AI research.

## Education 🎓
---
### PhD Computer Science, University of Birmingham

September 2019 - February 2025

Completed a PhD in Computer Science with a research focus on developing adversarially robust deep neural networks for security applications. Projects included: graph-based malware detection using control flow graphs with over 50,000 nodes; ensemble-based methods employing error correction codes; and optimisation techniques for analysing network similarity. This interdisciplinary work combined machine learning and cybersecurity to address critical challenges in securing AI systems.

### BSc Computer Science, University of Birmingham

September 2016 - July 2019

Graduated with first-class honours (GPA 4.25)

Dissertation: “Evolutionary Methods for Generating Secure Deep Neural Networks” - Evaluated the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to generate neural networks that are more robust to adversarial attacks.

## Employment History 💼
---

### Research Assistant, University of Birmingham

July 2025 - Present

Engineered a method for edit-tolerant video authentication to combat fake media. Coordinated with stakeholders to translate theoretical cryptographic techniques into practical, efficient methods for video processing capable of executing in just a few seconds. This is a UK RISE funded project scheduled for presentation in September 2025.

### Postgraduate Teaching Fellow, University of Birmingham

September 2021 - May 2022

Led marking initiatives by designing and implementing an automated marking system that efficiently evaluated over 600 students’ submissions in under four hours. Worked with lecturers, designing assignments to align with learning objectives and assessment criteria. The system enabled the use of practical assignments for assessment and ensured consistent and timely feedback for students.

### Postgraduate Teaching Assistant, University of Birmingham

September 2019 - September 2021

Facilitated the delivery of modules by leading interactive learning sessions and helping students grasp complex concepts and develop practical skills. Collaborated closely with faculty members and fellow TAs to create teaching materials, design assignments, and assess student progress, ensuring alignment with learning objectives.
